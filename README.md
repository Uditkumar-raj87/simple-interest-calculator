# Simple Interest Calculator

A simple yet powerful calculator tool to compute simple interest on any principal amount. This calculator helps you understand how interest accumulates over time based on a fixed interest rate.

## What is Simple Interest?

Simple interest is a method of calculating interest on a principal amount that doesn't compound. Unlike compound interest, simple interest is calculated only on the original principal amount throughout the loan or investment period. It's commonly used in short-term loans, savings accounts, and bonds.

## Formula

The formula for calculating simple interest is:

$$SI = \frac{P \times R \times T}{100}$$

Where:
- **SI** = Simple Interest
- **P** = Principal Amount (initial amount borrowed or invested)
- **R** = Rate of Interest per annum (% per year)
- **T** = Time Period (in years)

The **Total Amount** to be paid or received is:

$$A = P + SI$$

## Features

- ✅ Quick and accurate simple interest calculation
- ✅ User-friendly interface
- ✅ Instant results
- ✅ Support for various time periods (years, months, days)
- ✅ Clear breakdown of calculations
- ✅ No hidden fees or charges

## How to Use

1. **Enter Principal Amount**: Input the initial amount of money
2. **Enter Rate of Interest**: Specify the annual interest rate (in percentage)
3. **Enter Time Period**: Input the duration (in years or months)
4. **Calculate**: Click the calculate button to get results
5. **View Results**: See the simple interest and total amount due

## Usage Example

**Scenario**: You borrow $1,000 at 5% interest rate for 2 years

**Calculation**:
- Principal (P) = $1,000
- Rate (R) = 5% per annum
- Time (T) = 2 years

$$SI = \frac{1000 \times 5 \times 2}{100} = \frac{10000}{100} = 100$$

- Simple Interest = $100
- Total Amount = $1,000 + $100 = $1,100

## Key Differences from Compound Interest

| Aspect | Simple Interest | Compound Interest |
|--------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Calculation** | On principal only | On principal + accumulated interest |
| **Formula** | SI = P × R × T / 100 | A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt) |
| **Amount Growth** | Linear | Exponential |
| **Returns** | Lower | Higher |
| **Best For** | Short-term loans | Long-term investments |

## Common Use Cases

- **Personal Loans**: Calculate interest on short-term personal loans
- **Student Loans**: Some education loans use simple interest
- **Savings Accounts**: Traditional savings accounts sometimes use simple interest
- **Bonds**: Government and corporate bonds often use simple interest
- **Business Loans**: Short-term business financing
